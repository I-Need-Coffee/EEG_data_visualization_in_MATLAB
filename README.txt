The EEG_Vis.m file contains coordinates for two EEG systems used in our lab (ANT Neuro EEGO, MindMedia NEXUS).
Feel free to adjust coordinates to match your EEG system.

As it is presented here, the script requires a flat input array with dimensions [number of channels, 1]
This array must be called EEG.
